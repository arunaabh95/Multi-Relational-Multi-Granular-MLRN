## Multi-Realtional Multi-Granular MLRN

This project focuses on solving the I-RAVEN matrices. We generated the dataset from the code provided by the orignal [paper](https://github.com/husheng12345/SRAN/tree/0f1f76af5e69d955091d707cab20c6d25cabd2a7). The data we used is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JS3YYjs-8DmvllOdrq1N54gcfctunEV6?usp=sharing).

## Execution 
Just run the jupyter notebook after you have downloaded the dataset. To Understand the type of combinations we create as input to the relational layer you can check out the code that is commented under
